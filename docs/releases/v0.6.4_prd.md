# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - v0.6.4: RAG Evaluation Gates

**Release Date:** 2025-01-09  
**Status:** Draft  
**Author:** Dev-Lab-Assistant  
**Time Zone:** America/New_York  

## Executive Summary

This release establishes comprehensive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) evaluation gates to ensure quality, reliability, and performance of the AI-Enhanced Dev Lab's knowledge retrieval and synthesis capabilities. The release builds upon the existing RAG baseline (v0.6.2) and integrates DSPy modules with robust evaluation frameworks.

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Quality Assurance**: Implement automated evaluation gates that prevent regression in RAG system performance
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Establish baseline metrics and continuous monitoring for retrieval and generation quality
3. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate DSPy modules with existing RAG pipeline and MCP server infrastructure
4. **Production Readiness**: Prepare RAG components for promotion from lab to app scope

### Secondary Goals
1. **Deterministic Testing**: Ensure reproducible evaluation results across different environments
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Evaluate both retrieval and generation components with appropriate metrics
3. **Documentation**: Create clear evaluation procedures and success criteria
4. **Evidence Tracking**: Maintain detailed evidence logs for audit and compliance

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure (v0.6.3)
- **RAG Pipeline**: Complete implementation in `lab/rag/` with config-driven chunking and embedding
- **Evaluation Framework**: Basic evaluation harness in `lab/eval/` with deterministic testing
