# MCP Validation

## Health Check
- MCP server not currently running on localhost:8765
- Health endpoint not accessible (server not started)

## Notes
- MCP server would need to be started to perform health validation
- Non-allowlisted tool requests would be denied by policy when server is running
- This is expected behavior during freeze period

## Evidence Files
- Health check attempt: /tmp/mcp-health.json (empty - server not running)
