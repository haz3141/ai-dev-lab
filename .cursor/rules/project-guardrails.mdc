# Project Guardrails - AI-Dev-Lab v0.6.4

## Project Overview
- **Project**: AI-Enhanced Dev Lab v0.6.4
- **Focus**: MCP servers and RAG evaluation gates
- **Architecture**: Lab-to-app promotion workflow with security gates

## Core Guidelines

### Security Compliance
- All changes must pass security validation through Guardian
- PII redaction required for any sensitive data handling
- Audit logging mandatory for security-related operations
- Freeze guard compliance for production deployments

### Code Standards
- **Black formatting** as single source of truth
- **Conventional commits** for all changes (enforced by commitlint)
- **Code freeze policy**: 300 line limit for critical changes
- **Test coverage**: Minimum 68% threshold required

### Documentation Requirements
- **Version headers** required: `<!-- Version: 0.6.4 -->`
- **Cross-references** must be maintained and updated
- **Architecture diagrams** must reflect current state
- **Release notes** required for all deployments

### Development Workflow
- **Lab → App promotion** requires evaluation gates
- **Experimental features** must be documented with results
- **MCP server changes** require allowlist validation
- **RAG evaluation** must meet performance baselines

## Quality Gates
- ✅ Security audit passes
- ✅ Test coverage ≥ 68%
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Conventional commit format
- ✅ Black formatting applied

## Risk Mitigation
- Never commit untested experimental code to main
- Always validate MCP tool changes against allowlist
- Maintain audit trails for security decisions
- Freeze guard prevents unauthorized production changes
