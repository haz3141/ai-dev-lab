# Lab Development Rules

- Use `@lab` to reference lab/ folder experiments and tools
- Follow the existing patterns in lab/ for new experiments
- Document experimental results and findings
- Use proper testing patterns for lab tools
- Maintain separation between experimental and production code
- **RAG Evaluation**: When making changes to rag/ or eval/ directories, run local evaluation to ensure metrics.json is up to date
- **Evaluation Command**: Use `eval` command to run RAG evaluation gates locally
- **MCP Server**: Use `mcp` command to start the MCP server for testing
